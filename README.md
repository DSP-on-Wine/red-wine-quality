# Red Wine Quality Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical properties. The project will involve exploratory data analysis (EDA), baseline model development, feature engineering, model improvement, integration with FastAPI, Streamlit dashboard development, PostgreSQL database integration, Grafana dashboard creation, workflow management using Apache Airflow, and deployment of the machine learning model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties. The project will follow a structured approach, starting from data exploration and preprocessing, model development, integration with various technologies, and deployment in a production-like environment.

## Technologies Used

- Python (programming language)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (libraries for data manipulation and visualization)
- Scikit-learn (machine learning library)
- FastAPI (framework for building APIs)
- Streamlit (framework for building data-driven web applications)
- PostgreSQL (relational database management system)
- Grafana (open-source analytics and monitoring platform)
- Apache Airflow (workflow management platform)
